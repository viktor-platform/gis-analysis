This sample app demonstrates how to do a GIS-analysis in Viktor.

The goal of this app is to demonstrate some common GIS analyses using Viktor. This app was developed using an 
open-source library (`geopandas`), which provides a powerful toolkit for GIS-analysis. Using Viktor, complex analysis 
becomes easy to perform, accessible through the browser.

In this application the following functionalities are demonstrated:
- Uploading and visualizing custom GIS-data (shapefile, geopackage, geojson)
- Add filters to attribute table
- MapView interaction, analysis on selected features
- Download data as any GIS-datatype (shapefile, geopackage, geojson, autocad)
